This project explores three numerical schemes for solving 1-D partial differential equations coded in MatLab.
In this particular project we solve the 1-Dimensional heat diffusion in a rod.
The methods implemented and compared for time and optimal computing are: the Forward, explicit Euler Method, implicit direct backward euler, and finally an iterative method Runge-Kutta + Chebyschev Functions.

The files included in this project are as follows:
- RKC_project.m       -> The main project file
- rkc_params.m        -> Code for coefficient calculations
- RKC_stability.m     -> Code for stability regions
- Stability_Regions.m -> Code for visualizations of stability region
- plotS.m             -> Code for plotting the stability regions
- chebpoly ,1,2.m     -> Code with implementation of Chebyshev functions

A PDF of final results is also included for anyone that is interested!
